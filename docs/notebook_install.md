Data Cube Jupyter Notebook Installation Guide
=================

This document will guide users through the process of installing and configuring our Jupyter notebook Data Cube examples. In this guide, you will be required to install packages (Python and system level) and start a webserver.

<a name="introduction"></a> Introduction
========  
Jupyter notebooks are extremely useful as a learning tool and as an introductory use case for the Data Cube. Our Jupyter notebook examples include many of our algorithms and some basic introductory Data Cube API use tutorials. After we have installed all of the required packages, we will verify that our Data Cube installation is working correctly.  

<a name="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites
========  

To run our Jupyter notebook examples, the following prerequisites must be complete:

* The full Data Cube Installation Guide must have been followed and completed. This includes:
  * You have a local user that is used to run the Data Cube commands/applications.
  * You have a database user that is used to connect to your 'datacube' database.
  * The Data Cube is installed and you have successfully run `datacube system check`.

Before we begin, note that multiple commands should not be copied and pasted to be run simultaneously unless you know 
it is acceptable in a given command block. Run each line individually.

<a name="installation_process"></a> Installation Process
========  

You will need to be in the virtual environment for this entire guide. If you have not done so, please run:

```
source ~/Datacube/datacube_env/bin/activate
```

The Notebook repository can be downloaded as follows:

```
cd ~/Datacube
git clone https://github.com/ceos-seo/data_cube_notebooks.git
cd data_cube_notebooks
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

Now install the following Python packages:

```
pip install jupyter matplotlib scipy hdmedians rasterstats seaborn sklearn scikit-image lcmap-pyccd==2017.6.8 tqdm
pip install bokeh geopandas descartes
```

<a name="configuration"></a> Configuration
========  

The first step is to generate a notebook configuration file. 
Ensure that you're in the virtual environment. If not, activate with `source ~/Datacube/datacube_env/bin/activate`.
Then run the following commands:

```
cd ~/Datacube/data_cube_notebooks
jupyter notebook --generate-config

jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension
```

Jupyter will create a configuration file in `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`. 
Now set the password. Remember this password for future reference.

```
jupyter notebook password
```

Now edit the Jupyter notebook configuration file at `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` to include these relevant details:

```
c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
c.NotebookApp.port = 8080
```

Save the file and then run the notebook server with the following commands.
If this fails with a permissions error (`OSError: [...] Permission denied [...]`),
run the command `export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=""`.

```
cd ~/Datacube/data_cube_notebooks
nohup jupyter notebook &
```

Open a web browser and navigate to the notebook URL. If you are running your browser from the same machine that is 
hosting the notebooks, you can use `localhost:{jupyter_port_num}` as the URL, where `jupyter_port_num` is the port number set for `c.NotebookApp.port` in the configuration file.
If you are connecting from another machine, you will need to enter the public IP address of the server in the URL (which can be determined by running the `ifconfig` command on the server) in place of `localhost`. 
You should be greeted with a password field. Enter the password from the previous step.

<a name="using_notebooks"></a> Using the Notebooks
========  

Now that your notebook server is running and the Data Cube is set up, you can run any of our examples.

Open the notebook titled `Demo_Notebook`, change the `product` variable in the "Pick a product" cell near the beginning of the notebook to a product that you have, 
and run through all of the cells using either the "Run" button on the toolbar or `Shift+Enter` with the top cell selected.

You'll see that a connection to the Data Cube is established, some product metadata is queried, and some data is loaded and plotted.

<a name="next_steps"></a> Next Steps
========  
Now that we have the notebook server setup and our examples running, you are able to play with many of our algorithms and become more familiar with the Data Cube and accessing metadata and data. 
You may also consider setting up our web-based user interface. You can find that documentation [here](./ui_install.md).

<a name="faqs"></a> Common problems/FAQs
========  
----  

Q: 	
 >I’m having trouble connecting to my notebook server from another computer.

A:  
>	There can be a variety of problems that can cause this issue.<br><br>
    First check the IP and port number in your notebook configuration file.
    Be sure you are connecting to `localhost:<port>` if your browser is running on the same
    machine as the Jupyter server, and `<IP>:<port>` otherwise. 
    Also check that your firewall is not blocking the port that it is running on.
